= httparty

== DESCRIPTION:

Makes http fun again!

== FEATURES:

* Easy get, post requests
* Basic http authentication
* Default request query string parameters (ie: for api keys that are needed on each request)
* Automatic parsing of JSON and XML into ruby hashes based on response content-type

== EXAMPLES:

See http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master/examples

== COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

httparty also includes the executable <tt>httparty</tt> which can be
used to query web services and examine the resulting output. By default
it will output the response as a pretty-printed Ruby object (useful for
grokking the structure of output). This can also be overridden to output
formatted XML or JSON. Execute <tt>httparty --help</tt> for all the
options. Below is an example of how easy it is.
