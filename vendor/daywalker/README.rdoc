== FAQ

Q:: Why not use the existing gem, available at http://github.com/luigi/sunlight/tree/master ?
A:: Mostly, I didn't have a good experience when just poking around the Sunlight Labs API. I was dense and didn't activate my API key at first, but it didn't notice that. Even after activating, I wasn't getting any data back.
