  - Adding a new source -

    * Update sources.yml by hand with the new source, following the example of the sources already in there.  
    * Run "rake sources:load to *overwrite* the contents of the 'sources' table with the contents of sources.yml.
  
  - Modifying the database -
    
    * Create a new migration file in db/, following the example of prior migrations. Include an up and a down.
    * Run "rake db:migrate VERSION=N", where N is the version number of the migration you just made.
    * Run "rake db:migrate VERSION=M", where M is N - 1. This exercises the down method of the new migration.
    * Run "rake db:migrate VERSION=N" again.
