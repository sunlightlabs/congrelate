h1. Big Sheet

h3. Getting started

  * Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and modify as needed.
  * Copy sources/api_keys.yml.example to sources/api_keys.yml and add your API keys.
  * Run "rake db:migrate", then "rake sources:update". This may take a while.
  * Run "bigsheet.rb" to start the server.
  * Visit "http://localhost:4567" in your browser.

h3. Adding a new source

First, pick a keyword, unique among sources, that will identify the source. In the sources directory, create a directory with the keyword as the name, and place all relevant files in there.

A source consists of:
  * One or more model files.  One of the models must be named after the keyword (e.g. the "roll_call" source must have a RollCall class), but there can be other supplementary models.
  * A form partial, in HAML.
  * 

  * Update sources.yml by hand with the details of the new source.
  * Run "rake sources:load" to load sources.yml into the 'sources' table.
  * Add any database migrations to /db, and run "rake db:migrate".
