h1. Big Sheet

Joke's on you - it's in Sinatra.

h3. Getting started

  * The following gems need to be installed: sinatra, fastercsv, httparty, open-uri, json, hpricot, technicalpickles-daywalker (via GitHub)
  * Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and modify as needed.
  * Copy sources/api_keys.yml.example to sources/api_keys.yml and add your API keys.
  * Run "rake db:migrate", then "rake sources:update". This may take a while.
  * Run "bigsheet.rb" to start the server.
  * Visit "http://localhost:4567" in your browser.

h3. Adding a new source

  * Update sources.yml by hand with the details of the new source.
  * Run "rake sources:load" to load sources.yml into the 'sources' table.
  * Add any database migrations to /db, and run "rake db:migrate".
